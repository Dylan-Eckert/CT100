The Sound of Silence

A blanket of white!
Frosty tears of winter fall-
The sound of silence.

Perfect Perfume

exquisite white blossom
bathing in the sun
scents of spring cross my path

All the children

A thousand small kids
Floating on the summer wind
Dandelion seeds

September

As Autumn ignites,
The leaves burn with ember glow.
They fall like ashes
