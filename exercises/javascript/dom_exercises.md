## Modify Styles

Write JavaScript in `main.js` to manipulate the style of the page in the following way:

**Header**

- change the font size to 54 pixels
- change the color to some nice blue
- set a bottom border of your liking
- now just change the border color to hot pink

**Box**

- swap the width and height (lookup clientWidth and clientHeight)
- change the box from its top/left position, to a bottom/right position

## Add and remove Classes

- Create a css class to change the color and background color
- Toggle that class on the box


## Change Content

- Change the text of the header
- Add a h2 inside the box, aligned center

## Events

- Add a button to you page
- Create an event listener that will alert a message when clicked
- Make a function that does all the above changes

## Make it magical

Add this to your css file

```
* {
  transition: all .5s ease-in;
}
```
