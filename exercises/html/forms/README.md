# Forms

## Part 1
Time to implement everything you just learned about forms.  CodeTahoe needs a contact form for all the interested students.  Your first task is to create that form using this mock: contact-form.png.  Put this contact form on the contact page in the Code Tahoe site

## Part 2
Thanks to your amazing contact form, CodeTahoe is being flooded by people who want to register for the summer session.  One problem, we do not have a registration page.  Make a new page for registration and build a registration form from the register-form.png mock.
