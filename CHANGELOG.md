[DOM, DOM, DOM, DOM da DOM, DOM da DOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8)

I uploaded the solution to the todo exercise we did the other night.

Tonight we are going to be talking about objects.  Objects are the other data structure that we use in JS.  Everything is an object, that about sums it up. I uploaded javascript_5.md.  Taking a look before class will make class easier to digest ;)

We are almost to the super fun part of JS.  DOM, DOM, DOM, DOM da DOM, DOM da DOM (to the tune of the [Imperial March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8))

Great job last week everyone.  We did have some missing team mates and you guys really need to make sure you read javascript_3.md.  We will be discussing javascript_4.md tonight.  Read ahead and get ready.

Last night was great.  I feel like I almost made up for Monday.  But tonight we will start using the F word.  Its going to be like a punk song:  F this, F that, F everything.  But before that we will be finishing up looping.  There is one more loop at the bottom of javascript_2.md that we did not cover.  That is the foreach loop.

Bonus for next week:  We will start talking about JavaScript data structures: [Arrays](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) and [Objects](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp).  Take a look at the links and come with an edge on the insanity.

So last class was kind of rough.  Somehow I got derailed from my lesson plan and got on to functions.  I just got too excited... JS does that to me.   Tonight we will step back a bit and review following javascript_1.md and then we will start talking about logic, conditionals, and looping following javascript_2.md.  If I get sucked into functions, call me on it.

### What is a changelog?
- The change log is the history of all notable changes made to a repository.
- It allows you to get a summary of changes tied to a version
- I will be posting all updates for the course right here.

### Practice
- Go to any website and inspect it.  Look at the HTML on the page.  Look at the structure you see on the pages.  Just do some exploring.
- Play around in your terminal.  Move around, make some folders, files, and delete them.  Before you know it, you will be super comfortable in there.

**EXERCISE**

1. Create another repo on GitHub called yourname-profile (use your name)
2. Clone it to your computer
3. Create a new branch on your local computer to hold the work we will be doing tomorrow.  You are done for now.
4. FORK someone else repo in the class into your GH account then clone it to your local computer.

### Prep
- So we almost got all the way through the content last night.  We will finish up the git chat on Wednesday.
- We will start talking about HTML
- Feel free to take this [quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=HTML).  You will not be graded but it will help you know what you know or don't.  By the end of the class I want everyone to be able to pass this :)
- We are going to go over all of this content in class.  You can take a look to get an edge on the` conversation:
	- [HTML Basic](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)
	- [HTML Elements](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)
	- [HTML Attributes](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)
