### What is a changelog?
- The change log is the history of all notable changes made to a repository.
- It allows you to get a summary of changes tied to a version
- I will be posting all updates for the course right here.

### Practice
- Go to any website and inspect it.  Look at the HTML on the page.  Look at the structure you see on the pages.  Just do some exploring.
- Play around in your terminal.  Move around, make some folders, files, and delete them.  Before you know it, you will be super comfortable in there.

**EXERCISE**

1. Create another repo on GitHub called yourname-profile (use your name)
2. Clone it to your computer
3. Create a new branch on your local computer to hold the work we will be doing tomorrow.  You are done for now.
4. FORK someone else repo in the class into your GH account then clone it to your local computer.

### Prep
